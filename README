# Forta Bots by JJSOnChain
## Welcome
This repository showcases a collection of Forta bots developed by JJSOnChain. Forta bots are designed to monitor blockchain activity and provide real-time alerts and events for various use cases. This portfolio is intended for individuals interested in learning more about Forta bots and their applications, as well as serving as a showcase of my work in the field.

## About the Bots
The bots in this repository are designed to monitor various blockchain protocols and assets. Each bot is configured to detect specific events and conditions, such as flashloans, liquidations, and other market movements.

## Repository Structure
This repository is quite easy to navigate. You click on the bot you are interested in, there you will see a `README` file to explain the bot briefly, and the bot files (logic and tests).
